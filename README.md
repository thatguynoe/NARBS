# Noe's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts (NARBS)

My NARBS config is heavily inspired by [Luke Smith's build](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS), which I strongly encourage you to check out for more info.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/thatguynoe/NARBS
cd NARBS
sh narbs.sh
```
